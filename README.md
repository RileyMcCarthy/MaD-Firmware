# First-time Setup

## Platform.io

Platform.io must be installed inside Visual Studio Code to build firmware: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#installation

Make sure to remove previous Platform Propeller installations under Platform.io-> Home -> Platforms

Install the Propeller Platform.io platform using the instructions at the link below
https://github.com/RileyMcCarthy/platform-propeller

Once the custom Platform.io platform is installed clone this repository

`https://github.com/RileyMcCarthy/MaD-Firmware.git`

To build the firmware open the MaD-Firmware folder to compile and upload!
